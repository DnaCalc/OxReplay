### BLK-REPLAY-001: First implementation stack undeclared

- **Status**: resolved
- **Impact**: `W002` through `W006` activation packet quality
- **Current state**: Rust-first implementation direction is now declared, the active Cargo workspace root is `src/`, workspace checks are explicit, and the workset packets now reference the chosen stack
- **Exact unblock steps**: none; resolved by the Rust-first baseline update and execution-packet expansion
- **Recommendation**: workaround
- **Opened**: 2026-03-16
- **Resolved**: 2026-03-16
